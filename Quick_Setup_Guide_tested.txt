Key Strengths
Architecture
Well-structured state machine with clear separation of concerns

Evaluation
Multi-metric assessment using industry-standard tools

Production Ready
Complete CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment setup

Implementation Flow
1
Query Processing
User query enters the LangGraph state machine

2
Document Retrieval
ChromaDB retrieves relevant context using semantic search

3
Evaluation
TruLens and Ragas assess groundedness, relevance, and confidence

4
Decision Point
System decides: clarify or answer based on confidence thresholds

5
Response
Either generates targeted questions or provides final answer
